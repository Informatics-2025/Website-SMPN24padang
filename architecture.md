# Architecture

This document outlines the technical architecture of the SMPN 24 Padang website.

## Key Technologies

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Database ORM**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Authentication**: [Auth.js (NextAuth.js)](https://authjs.dev/)
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Directory Structure

The project follows a structure conventional for Next.js applications.

- `src/app/`: The core of the application, using the Next.js App Router. Each folder represents a route.
  - `admin/`: Routes for the admin dashboard.
  - `api/`: API routes for server-side logic.
- `src/components/`: Shared and reusable React components.
  - `ui/`: Components from shadcn/ui.
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions, database configuration (`db/`), and authentication logic (`auth.ts`).
- `public/`: Static assets like images, fonts, and icons.
- `drizzle/`: Contains database migration files generated by Drizzle ORM.
- `scripts/`: Contains standalone scripts for various tasks like database initialization or admin management.

## Database

The application uses Drizzle ORM to interact with the database. This provides a type-safe way to query the database. Database schema changes are managed through migration files located in the `drizzle/` directory.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled by Auth.js (formerly NextAuth.js). The configuration is located in `auth.config.ts` and `src/lib/auth.ts`. The `middleware.ts` file is used to protect routes and redirect unauthenticated users.

## Styling

The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS. Global styles are defined in `src/app/globals.css`, and the configuration is in `tailwind.config.ts`. Components are built using shadcn/ui, which provides a set of accessible and customizable components.
